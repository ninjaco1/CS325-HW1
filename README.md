In this assignment there was task given to us, and the task is to program two different types of sorting algorithms. The two algorithms that was implemented was insertion sort and merge sort. The implement for this will be in `mergesort.py` and `insertionsort.py`.

In this two files the task was to read data from the file `data.txt` and with that data you would have to sort it then output the sorted data in `output.txt`.

After getting the sorting algorithms to work, I collected data on the run of each sorting algorithms. The code for that will be in `mergeTime.py` and `insertTime.py`. In these two files you the task was to have 10 n sizes for an array. For example, n can be n = 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 ... In each element of the array you want to generate a random number ranging from 0 to 10,000. After the arrays are filled you want to run the sorting algorithms 3 times and take the average of the runs. You have to do this because each run time can vary. Then you want to take the time and put in a text file(`mergetime.txt` and `inserttime.txt`). Then this data was later on used in excel to compare the run times between insertion and merge sort.
